**Project Title:** Development of a multi-atlas for the automated segmentation of chest MR image sets at different inflation levels in a respiratory context

**Supervisor:** Alberto Biancardi

**Background:**
MR chest imaging has shown great opportunity for the identification of quantitative imaging-based biomarkers in the respiratory context. Although possible alternatives can be found, a global approach to analysis automation requires a reliable segmentation of the main structures, namely lungs and airways, at different inflation levels. Not only is manual segmentation a time-consuming and exhausting process, however, clinical conditions and diseases, such as cystic fibrosis or interstitial lung disease, can obfuscate the actual extents of the anatomy being analysed. Towards this, multi-atlas segmentation using joint label fusion has demonstrated to be a competitive method of segmentation automation.
